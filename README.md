# Slides

This repository contains a collection of slides that I'll be using for my presentations.

All of these slides will be using the `present` tool that can be found [here](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present).

## Usage

Create a virtual environment with the `present` program installed.

```
$ virtualenv -p python3 .ve/
$ source .ve/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a set of slides.

```
$ present <slide>
```
